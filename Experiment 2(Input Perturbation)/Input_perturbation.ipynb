From the Revolutionary War to modern-day mass shootings, firearms have been used to protect, to harm, and to control. However, in recent decades, gun violence has become more frequent and more deadly. In 2020 alone, there were over 40,000 deaths due to firearm injuries in the United States.

The author describes the dog as \"a constant source of noise and chaos\" and complains about how it barks all day and night, making it impossible for them to sleep or enjoy their own home. The author also mentions that they have tried talking to their neighbor about the issue, but the neighbor just laughs it off and doesn't do anything to address the problem.
